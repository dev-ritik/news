<div align="center">
A fake news building and hosting website!</div><br>


## Overview
Usually spreading fake-news or propaganda requires a fake website and related infrastructure.
This comes with a significant drawback of the untrusty display name.
But for spreading fake-news on social platforms like Whatsapp generally requires a weblink to support the propaganda.

The sole purpose of this web app is to make such fakes look authentic by _**impersonating the authentic website!!.**_

Currently, it has only a Times of India support added.

## Working
* The static file of the original file shall be saved in the server.
* User shall get a form to fill all the details like Headlines, date-time, content etc.
* Upon submission of the form, a web page will be displayed with the required data appropriately rendered.
* The link of the _near authentic_ webpage can be copied to any of the social media platforms.
* Whenever someone from targetted audience visits the website, he shall judge the malicious content in an authentic looking environment.
* Plus, we get all the benefits we could have got from a fake website like Analytics, etc.

## catches
* The domain name shall be different. _(But who cares!!)_
* The webpage will not exactly impersonate the original one and certain detail shall be missing.
